The project is designed to demonstrate the use of machine learning in solving real-world problems. Depending on the domain, potential applications include:

Predictive Analytics (e.g., predicting sales, stock prices).
Classification Tasks (e.g., spam detection, disease diagnosis).
Regression Analysis (e.g., house price prediction, demand forecasting).
