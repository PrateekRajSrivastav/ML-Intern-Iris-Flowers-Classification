This project showcases the typical machine learning workflow:

Data Exploration:
The dataset is analyzed to understand the structure, identify trends, and find missing or outlier values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves creating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Preprocessing:
Data cleaning includes handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and encoding categorical variables. Numerical features are scaled to ensure better performance of machine learning models.

Model Building:
Various algorithms are applied to solve the problem, depending on whether it's classification, regression, or clustering. Models are trained using Scikit-Learn and optimized through hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation:
The trained models are evaluated on test data to ensure generalization. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or MSE provide insights into performance. Visualization tools (e.g., confusion matrices) further enhance interpretability.

Reproducibility:
The Google Colab Notebook ensures that anyone can easily run the project without additional setup. Simply upload data and follow the workflow to reproduce results.
